## How to contribute

In all cases, it's best to communicate with the repository owners! If you are hoping to make a small change, directly creating a pull request is a good option (but feel free to communicate via an issue ahead of time). For bigger changes that add whole new features or change functionality, it's better to discuss in an issue first to ensure there is alignment. 

The full process would thus be:

1. Open an issue which is a bug report or feature request, detail your proposal
1. Owners give the go ahead with any guidance
1. Create your branch/fork
    1. If you don't have edit access to the repo, then fork the entire project on github. If you have edit access, go to next sub bullet.
    1. If a `dev` branch exists, check it out; otherwise, check out the `main` branch.
    1. Now create an appropriately named branch, add commits there
1. Run GUT tests to ensure everything is working as expected (nothing new broken)
1. Create a pull request, requesting to merge back into `main` (or into `dev` if that branch exists), and explicitly request review (add an owner)
    - Best practice: Assign the relating issue to the pull request (or vice versa) in the GitHub UI so it's clear what it relates to.
1. Owners will review and likely give feedback. Don't be discouraged! But to get an edge, see the dev guidance below.
1. Author responds to comments, makes changes if appropriate. Go back one step to re-review
1. An owner approves, and indicates to the author if/when to merge
1. Author merges in the PR (owners may do this step if an approval is there and author is not responding)

## How to run tests

In order to submit changes, you should run the repository tests (and consider adding new tests to validate new functionality). 

To get GUT set up:

1. Download the latest [bitwes/GUT release here](https://github.com/bitwes/Gut/releases/) (download the source code/zip).
1. Then, unzip the download.
1. Copy the 'gut' folder from this downloaded folders addons/gut subfolder (to be explicit: you are just copying one folder from the unzipped archive, not the entire thing)
1. Paste this folder to be next to the road-generator folder under addons in your road-generator repo.
1. Enable the plugin: Go to Project > Project Settings > Plugins tab, ensure GUT is enabled.

To run tests, you now should see a "GUT" tab at the bottom of your main window (to the right of Animation). Inside this window, you just need to `Run All` to run all tests.

You can also run tests from the command line (script set up for Linux/Max OSX):

1. Create a `godot_versions.txt` file in the root of the repo. This should not be checked in (already added to gitignores)
1. Create a single line with the path to the godot versions you want to use for testing. It should be the full path to the binary executable (not just the .app, for instance on OSX)
1. Then execute `run_tests.sh` and you should see test results in progress. As of this writing, Godot opens, tests run, and then godot closes all in less than 5 seconds.


## General guidance

- See [these high level requirements](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/community/asset_library/submitting_to_assetlib.html) of a plugin in the Asset Library. Be sure to follow all of these.
- Follow the [official GDscript](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_styleguide.html) base code style
	- Owners will comment and request changes to ensure code style matches, so don't be surprised by this (or take offense!)
- Generally try to additionally follow the [incremental style guide](https://www.gdquest.com/docs/guidelines/best-practices/godot-gdscript/) set forth by GDQuest, which adds several useful additional conventions.
- To reiterate a subset of what these code style guidelines indicate, you should:
	- Be using typing where possible (sometimes cyclic issues break this in 3.x)
	- Follow naming convention
	- More lines of code is ok if it makes what is happening clearer.

If in doubt, reach out to the owners by opening an issue. You can also join the Wheel Steal discord for more realtime engagement: discord.gg/gttJWznb4a
